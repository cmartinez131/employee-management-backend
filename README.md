# final-backend

backend works with remote front end
we had some trouble with deploying with github pages so the project should be deployed to two urls in the case one does not work
https://minseo27.github.io/employee-management-frontend/
https://glittery-pavlova-c7960e.netlify.app/


backend needs to be run locally
to run backend clone the reposotory and run in the terminal
 - node app.js

this should run the backend locally and load the data to the frontend
